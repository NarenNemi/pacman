# pacman
a simple demo of a pacman moving left to right by its own accord.
Using the checkPageBounds function the pacman will reverse his direction once it recognizes its reach the width of the window.
I plan to later on increase the functionality of his movement by allowing users to manipulate where he shall move to.
To use this application simply download all files then open the index.html from the folder.
