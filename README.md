# pacman
a simple demo of a pacman moving left to right by its own accord.
Using the checkPageBounds function the pacman will reverse his direction once it recognizes its reach the width of the window.
I plan to later on increase the functionality of his movement by allowing users to manipulate where he shall move to.
